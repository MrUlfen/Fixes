# HOW TO PREVENT AND PRESERVE GPU LONGER

#### Most of the time the fps is uncaped, witch means 999+ to unlimited
now that being said this is important what type of screen/monitor you have and what refresh rate the monitor has. 

**an example is** *30* *60* *75* *100* *144* *200* *265* usualy it can say 60<sub>Herts</sub> or **60**<sub>HZ</sub>

# Optional fixes to prevent gpu degradation

> 1. cap every game you play to either 60 fps or the same refreshrate as you monitor. This is somthing yourself have to se and its not for every one but it helps the gpu alot capping the gpu or **FPS** at 60 or monitor.
>
> 2. play in **LOW** graphics in games or medium if you dont care about how the games look.
