# Understanding Viruses: How They Work and How to Protect Yourself

## What is a Trojan Virus?

A Trojan virus, often simply referred to as a "Trojan," is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate software to gain unauthorized access to a system. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves. Instead, they rely on deception to trick users into executing them.

### Common Infection Vectors

Trojans can infect systems through various means, including:

- **Downloads:** They can be bundled with seemingly harmless files or software from untrustworthy sources.
- **Game Mods:** Custom modifications for games may include Trojans if downloaded from unofficial or shady sites.
- **Websites:** Malicious links or compromised websites can prompt users to download and execute Trojans.

### Detection and Removal

Most antivirus programs are designed to detect and remove Trojans. However, their effectiveness can vary:

- **Windows Defender:** This is a basic antivirus tool that comes pre-installed with Windows. While it provides some level of protection, it may not always be sufficient.
- **Third-Party Antivirus Software:** Tools like **Total AV** offer more comprehensive protection and are recommended for better security.
